      I chase you to the rising sun

      I step back as the moon had done

      I take your Mercury as if it won't hurt me

      I see on Venus the endless possibilities

      I look back to the home we built on Earth

      I swore on Mars I didn't feel your hurt

      On my special day, you gave me Jupiter's ring

      Today I sit on Saturn, not feeling a thing

      You and Uranus' jokes filled my skies

      He took my face and I found Neptune in my eyes

      As Pluto died, so did we

      The universe uncovered the truth I needed to see

      The constellations pointed to your name

      But your clouds covered it just the same
